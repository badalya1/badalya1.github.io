# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This site is built using the Nuxt framework, styled with Tailwind CSS and SCSS, and hosted fully for free using every possible way to cut down the cost to 0.

## Technologies Used

- Framework: Nuxt
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, SCSS
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Images: Cloudflare Interplanetary File System Gateway and Cloudinary

## How it Works

The website is built using Nuxt, generated using experimental context extractor. The styling is done using a combination of Tailwind CSS and SCSS. The nuxt project includes a github action which copies the `./dist` folder to a public repository. Another Github action then hosts it on github pages.

To cut down on hosting costs, I'm using a combination of free services:

- GitHub Pages: to host the static website generated by Nuxt.
- Strapi: to manage projects, bookmarks, etc.
- Filebase/ Pinata Strapi Provider: to upload images to IPFS.
- Cloudflare IPFS: to query images from IPFS
- Cloudinary: to access images with less chances of failing

## Conclusion

By using Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, and SCSS, and hosting my site using a combination of free services, I'm able to keep the cost of running my personal website to a minimum. Despite being hosted for free, the site is fast, reliable, and easy to manage.
