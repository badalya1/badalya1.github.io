The website offers a range of features that make it a valuable resource for students looking to manage their academic lives. With the ability to track grades in real-time, make predictions based on data from past grades, and connect with classmates, GradeHunt can help students stay on top of their academic work and make informed decisions about their courses. Additionally, the website can help students save money by allowing them to make predictions about their final grades, and in the future, GradeHunt plans to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) into its predictions, as well as release a mobile app, making the website even more accessible to students.\n\nStudents can enter their grades for each assignment and exam, and the website will automatically calculate their overall percentage. This makes it easy to monitor progress in each class and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**GradeHunt** offers a useful feature that allows you to predict your final grades. It uses data from your past grades and other factors to give you an estimate of what your final grade will be in each class. This can be a great help for students who are trying to plan their schedules and ensure they are on track to achieve their academic goals.\n\n## How it works\n\nImagine you have a final exam coming up. Obviously you don't know what you are going to get on the exam (unless you are Rick Sanchez). Since it is unknown, we cannot describe the grade with certainty, but we can describe it with a probability distribution. Luckily, in probability theory there is a similar principle. \n\n\n\u003EIf a system has a probabilistic description, this description gives the probability of any configuration, and given any two different configurations, there is a state which is partly this and partly that, with positive real number coefficients, the probabilities, which say how much of each there is.\n[Quantum Superposition - Wikipedia](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FQuantum_superposition#Analogy_with_probability)\n\nWith this in mind, if we have a probabilistic description of upcoming valuables (tests, exams, quizzes, assignments etc.), we can calculate probabilistic description of the final grade.\n\n\n\n\n",completion:k,links:{github:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgradehunt"},createdAt:"2023-02-02T10:13:01.694Z",updatedAt:"2023-02-25T13:15:02.987Z",publishedAt:"2023-02-02T10:15:50.514Z",slug:"gradehunt",intro:"GradeHunt is a web app designed to help university students keep track of grades, make predictions and connect with classmates.",status:a,splash:{id:l,dark:{data:{id:m,attributes:{name:"gradehunt-logo-dark.svg",alternativeText:n,caption:a,width:o,height:p,formats:{},hash:"gradehunt_logo_dark_3c83d55b16",ext:c,mime:d,size:10.61,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcloudflare-ipfs.com\u002Fipfs\u002Fbafybeic6rhoxachhgcrsz5idgnsyjy3xnyl5qucfylcwjsvowzj5on56nm",previewUrl:a,provider:b,provider_metadata:a,createdAt:"2023-02-02T11:16:34.844Z",updatedAt:"2023-02-11T14:14:18.092Z"}}},light:{data:{id:9,attributes:{name:"gradehunt-logo-light.svg",alternativeText:n,caption:a,width:o,height:p,formats:{},hash:"gradehunt_logo_lightsvg_f5b6f1b459",ext:c,mime:d,size:10.51,url:"https:\u002F\u002Fcloudflare-ipfs.com\u002Fipfs\u002Fbafybeic5657s2tdq5wften5o7adrfmnd64nsw25y55w46nduu3byepplui",previewUrl:a,provider:b,provider_metadata:a,createdAt:"2023-02-02T11:16:34.933Z",updatedAt:"2023-02-11T14:14:05.780Z"}}}}}},{id:2,attributes:{name:"General Journal",in_progress:i,start_date:"2022-12-21",end_date:a,description:"General Journal is an easy-to-use personal accounting software that makes managing your finances straightforward and hassle-free.

The website you are currently on is a testament to my dedication to my craft and my passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. It is an ever-evolving platform that I use to showcase the projects I have worked on, the blog posts I have written, and the skills I have acquired over the years. I am constantly striving to improve my work and to stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies.\n\nI am also constantly working to improve this portfolio website by regularly updating it with new projects and by adding new skills that I have learned. I strive to remain at the cutting edge of the latest web development trends and technologies, so that I can provide the best possible experience for my clients. Additionally, I am always open to feedback and suggestions on how I can further improve my portfolio website.\n\n## Challenges\n\nThe goal of this project is to utilize all free options provided to develop and host this website. Here's how the workflow works:\n1. Run a Strapi server and Nuxt app locally for development.\n2. Make necessary changes to the app and content in the Strapi dashboard.\n3. Generate a static site with a crawler and context extractor.\n4. Push all changes to the main branch of the Github repository.\n5. A Github action will check if the dist folder has been changed and copy the dist folder into a public repository.\n6. Another Github action in the public repo will deploy the changes to Github Pages.\n\n\nHowever, there are some additional problems that need to be addressed. The website contains images that need to be hosted somewhere. Uploading those images to Github will take a long time on steps 4 and 5. The solution is to use a Strapi provider to upload the files to the Interplanetary File System using [Filebase](https:\u002F\u002Ffilebase.com) or [Pinata](https:\u002F\u002Fapp.pinata.cloud\u002F). Then, we can keep the CID of each image and use Cloudflare endpoints to request each image. This works perfectly for free, except that Cloudflare might block requests with status `429 Too many requests` if the user navigates to pages that contain many images.",completion:k,links:a,createdAt:"2023-02-04T05:51:56.554Z",updatedAt:"2023-03-06T11:34:36.642Z",publishedAt:"2023-02-04T05:52:06.550Z",slug:"portfolio",intro:"A portfolio  website that shows off projects and blog posts.
